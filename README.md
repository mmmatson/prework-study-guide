# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to structure notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript from prework in a coding bootcamp on a webpage, so that I could easily find and read the information. I learned basic information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and became comfortable with using a few basic Git commands to complete this project. I would like to improve this project in the future by including links to helpful websites and adding other common git commands as I learn more about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in the coding bootcamp.
