        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The charset element element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element. The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash. We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, etc. elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image, as shown in the following code. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use inline CSS to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references, such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[insert descriptive message]": The -m flag associates a message with a commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in the base branch. It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes up changes made in a branch.</li>
          <li>git checkout main: navigates to the base branch.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It's not a function object.</li>
          <li>A truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.</li>
          <li>The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.</li>
