        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use inline CSS to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references, such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It's not a function object.</li>
          <li>A truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.</li>
          <li>The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.</li>
