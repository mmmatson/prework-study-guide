        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use inline CSS to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references, such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
